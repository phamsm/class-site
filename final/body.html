        <div class="smalltext">deep breathing: take five deep, full breaths at least once a day – and better yet, several times throughout the day for a calming and rejuvenated effect.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="smalltext">take a stretch: go for a few minutes of stretching exercises first thing in the morning to help get the blood flowing and to rejuvenate the body.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="smalltext">check your posture: you may not consciously think about the alignment of your shoulders, head, and back very often, but straightening your posture can help you feel more confident and help increase blood flow as well as create more efficient use of your muscles.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="smalltext">work up a sweat: one of the best actions you can take for your body is exercise. whether you’re headed to the gym or getting a workout in at home, regular exercise can help you maintain a strong, vibrant body.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="smalltext">get in a good soak: taking a relaxing bubble bath (organic bath salts, please) can help your muscles and mind relax and calm down. for added effect, throw in some high quality epsom salt to help detoxify an acidic body pH.</div>
