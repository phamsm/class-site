    <div class="smalltext">hi :-)</div>
    <div class="smalltext">i'm a student at vcuarts, majoring in graphic design, minoring in painting & printmaking.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">before entering the world of graphic design, my main ways of arting included painting (acrylic) and illustrating (pen—micron pens are my loves). i also dabbled in embroidery.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">now that i've indulged in all things graphic design, i'm an absolute whore for illustrator. using a wacom tablet in illustrator is *chef's kiss*. i also have an ipad pro that is also *chef's kiss*. procreate is a beautiful thing.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">i recently ordered some bamboo embroidery hoops to hopefully get back into dabbling in embroidery, maybe even become a pro, who knows.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">i also ordered some resin things: the resin itself, some different kinds of molds (hair clips, ash/jewelry trays, combs), metallic leaf flakes, etc. i may or may not sell some things i make :-O</div>
    <div class="smalltext">stardew valley is a glorious game, it takes up a hefty load of my time. i'm currently on year three in the great season of fall. so far i've named every thing able to be named after greek mythological beings. my character's name is aphrodite and her farm is the ethereal farm. she's got a cat named nyx and a horse named medousa.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">i'm a very big avatar: the last airbender fan and i'm so happy it's on netflix but so sad i paid like 30 dollars for season 1 on prime video. i have it forever now though so that's ok i suppose. i finished the series for the millionth time though. i ordered the first graphic novel that continues the story after the series ends so i've been going through that but i'm almost done with it already so i think i will order the next one soon.</div>
    <div class="smalltext">not sure what else to write so uhhhhhhhhhh feel free to visit my instagram(s) linked below :-)</div>
